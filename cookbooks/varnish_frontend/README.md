varnish_frontend
================
This recipe puts varnish on port 80, and then pushes the requests to haproxy.  This differs from the default varnish recipe, where varnish is proxied to after haproxy.

Notice
=======
This recipe is for example use only.  This script modifies the default behaviour of app instances and is not supported by Engine Yard.
